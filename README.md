Hello everyone,

I recently completed a small project to practice my JavaScript skills. I created a Password Generator with a length of 12 characters, and also added a dark mode feature to the site.

To generate the password, I used the random method to randomly select characters from a variable called "characters". I then created a function to increment these characters using a for loop and stored the result in a span tag. 

The copy method was challenging to implement, but I was able to create a method to copy the newly generated password to the clipboard.

You can find a site here. https://karol-passgen.netlify.app/

Have fun coding and see you later!
